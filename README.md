A async, thread-safe statsd client library with influxed tags support if you use statsd enhancement - influxed-statsd.

This library can also work with standard statsd. 

Since I use google logging library and our own thead library and build tools in implementation, you may need to make small changes so it can work in your own code base. Please feel free to use it. If you have any question, please email me: yuanruic@qq.com
